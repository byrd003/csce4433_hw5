To run part 1:
    run hmac_enc.py with 'python hmac_enc.py'
        Input message
            This will store HMAC generated and message into mactext
    run hmac_vfy.py to verify HMAC signature - 'python hmac_vfy.py'
        Output will tell if signature is valid

To run part 2:
    run rsa_enc.py with 'python rsa_enc.py'
        Input message
            This will store signature generated and message into sigtext
    run rsa_vfy.py to verify RSA signature - 'python rsa_vfy.py'
        Output will tell if signature is valid

To run part 3:
    run average.py with 'python average.py'
    input message for first part > Output 1
    input message for second part > Output 2

To run part 4 (not finished):
    'python part4.py'
    Could not figure out how to hash while iterating through list
        Probably overthought process
        Once I could hash through the list, I could run a check, but I know
        that that was not asked for.
